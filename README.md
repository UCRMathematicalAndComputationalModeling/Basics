# Basics
## Installing python
If you don't have python already on your system, you will need to install it. Please install the latest version of python available here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
## Installing required python modules for PSY 234
### Installing with "pip"
Now that you have python installed, we would like to install additional modules, or libraries, to enable us to use python for computational modeling. 
We recommend installing the python modules needed for this course using "pip" (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/). 
To do so, install pip using the directions provided here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. Next, clone this git repository to your home directory. Finally, open a terminal, cd into the folder that you have just cloned, and type 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### matplolib
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/users/installing.html
### pandas
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
### scikit-learn
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
### tensorflow
Head over to the tensorflow website here https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ and select your operating system. Make sure to install the CPU version of tensorflow, as all course examples are relatively compute-friendly (small datasets, models with relatively few parameters). Using the native "pip" installation is easiest and recommended.
