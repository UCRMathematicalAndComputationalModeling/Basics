## Installing required python modules for PSY 234
### Installing with "pip"
We recommend installing python modules using "pip" (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/). To install the modules required for course work, install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), download the requirements text file we hav eprovided into your home directory, open a terminal, and type 
***pip install -r requirements.txt
### matplolib
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/users/installing.html
### pandas
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
### scikit-learn
Please install the latest version of matplotlib using "pip". More info can be found here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
### tensorflow
Head over to the tensorflow website here https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ and select your operating system. Make sure to install the CPU version of tensorflow, as all course examples are relatively compute-friendly (small datasets, models with relatively few parameters). Using the native "pip" installation is easiest and recommended.
